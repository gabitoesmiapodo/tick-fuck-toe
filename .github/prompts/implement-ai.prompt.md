Implement a "human-like" AI for Tic Tac Toe.

Constraints:
- Single difficulty
- Sometimes picks a non-optimal move (configurable probability constant)
- Otherwise plays reasonably (block immediate wins, take wins)
- No minimax required
- No delay

Integrate into game flow: after human move, AI moves automatically if game not finished.
Validate with pnpm type-check and pnpm lint.
