# Game layer rules (pure)
- Do not access DOM, window, document, localStorage, or timers
- Expose a small API (Game class or pure functions) that UI can call
- Model state explicitly (board, current player, status)
- AI move selection must be deterministic given (state, rng) or accept an injected random function
